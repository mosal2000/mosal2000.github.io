              Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income
            </h2>
            <p>
              Low-income Americans also have higher rates of behavioral risk
              factors—smoking, obesity, substance use, and low levels of
              physical activity—which are powerfully influenced by the more
              challenging home and community environments in which they live.
              For example, poorer neighborhoods have a higher density of tobacco
              retailers, and the tobacco industry has historically targeted
              low-income people through various marketing strategies. Low-income
              people may also have limited access to cessation counseling
              services and pharmacotherapies and may experience higher levels of
              chronic stress—all of which make it more difficult to stop
              smoking. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people in families that earn less
              than $35,000 a year are three times more likely to smoke as those
              in families with an annual income of more than $100,000.
            </p>

            <p>
              Low-income communities also contend with other structural
              challenges that contribute to higher rates of obesity and chronic
              disease, including less access to fresh foods; a higher density of
              fast-food restaurants; and a built environment that is not
              conducive to physical activity, with less open space and fewer
              parks and sidewalks. As a result, poor adults have higher rates of
              obesity and are less likely to meet guideline-recommended levels
              of physical activity, compared to other adults.
            </p>

            <p>
              More broadly, low-income Americans encounter numerous daily
              environmental exposures that create greater allostatic load—the
              wear and tear on the body that accumulates with repeated or
              chronic stressors. The communities in which low-income people live
              have higher levels of violence, discrimination, and material
              deprivation—including the lack of housing, heat, water, and
              electricity. These communities have more environmental pollutants,
              underresourced schools, and higher rates of unemployment and
              incarceration. For residents with a home, the threat of eviction
              is commonplace, as more than one in five renting families in the
              United States spends half of its income on housing. A robust
              literature links chronic stressors, including financial hardship,
              to deleterious genetic and hormonal changes—such as impaired DNA
              repair mechanisms and higher cortisol and adrenaline levels—that
              increase the risk of chronic disease. The negative cardiometabolic
              effects of poverty seem to start early and continue throughout the
              life course.
